# Puppeteer

> A library which provides a high level api control over chromium (Chrome Engine) over DevTools protocol.

Runs headless by default ie (Brings all the features of chrome to the server and command line.)

**A headless browser is a great tool for automated testing and server environments where you don't need a visible UI shell. For example, you may want to run some tests against a real web page, create a PDF of it, or just inspect how the browser renders an URL.**
